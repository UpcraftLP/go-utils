# go-utils

Monorepo for a bunch of small command line utilities, written in [go](https://golang.org).



to build all tools, simply run the `build` script:

*in **CMD**:*

```cmd
build.cmd 1.0.0
```

*in **Powershell**:*

```powershell
.\build.cmd 1.0.0
```



You will then find the outputs in the `bin` directory.
